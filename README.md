# Flashcards Project

A project developed for my thinkful course, this is a React-based flashcard application to be used for studying.
Fully developed in React using JSX and react-router-dom.
This app can be used to create any custom decks/cards that a user would need for studying any subject.
This project made me very familiar with using an advanced framework to make front-end applications.
